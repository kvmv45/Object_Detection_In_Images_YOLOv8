# Object_Detection_In_Images_YOLOv8

This repository provides a simple setup for performing object detection using the YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model known for its high accuracy and speed.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Quickly run object detection without complex installations.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Use pre-trained YOLOv8 models (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`) for immediate inference.
- **Image Upload**: Easily upload images directly to any Software Tools(such as Colab,VS Code) for detection.
- **Visualization**: Display detected objects with bounding boxes on the input image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account to access Google Colab (or) Setup of VS code.
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Instructions in Google Colab

1. Open the `Colab` notebook provided in this repository.
2. Change the runtime type to GPU for faster processing.
3. Run the cells to install dependencies and load the YOLOv8 model.
4. Upload your image and execute the detection function to see results.

### Usage

The code allows you to detect objects in images by simply uploading an image file. Detected objects will be displayed with bounding boxes and labels.
